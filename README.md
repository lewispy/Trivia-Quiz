# Trivia Quiz
This app simulates a Trivia quiz process using the API of Open Trivia Database.
The app features a friendly user interface where users respond true or false to questions and track their scores as they answer.
A total of 50 trivia questions are featured in each simulation.
Since a fresh request is made each time the app is run, the question bank is not identical to previous versions.
Enjoy!
